    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll try to post an article through the octopress to github from today.</p>

<p>I wrestled with JavaScript and node.js, and also touched
on a variety of other languages, here about six months.
However, I did not leave anything as a record,
I decided to start recording, even little by little,
something did, something struggled(has been struggle),
and something to try.</p>

<p>I chose the github for log, because I think it is the best  warehouse
for development projects, and I think whether it is reasonable
to place a blog near it.</p>

<p>I think most of the records are for myself,
but I want to be able to leave the articles for someone&#8217;s help.</p>

<p>(and I try to write in English)</p>
